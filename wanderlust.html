	<section class="description">
		<p>Wanderlust is a mobile app that allows users to explore travel inspiration by location. We focused our efforts on the photo and location sharing aspect of the app, which includes post submission and search functionality. Our objective was to curate user-generated content and organize posts in a way in which obscure locations would not be overshadowed by popular travel destinations.</p>

		<h2>Exploring Wanderlust</h2>
		<p>Wanderlust was intended to have two key features: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>A photo-sharing system in which users can search and sort through user generated content</li>
			<li>Local recommendations and reviews, which would allow users to learn about fun and inexpensive places in the area.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>My teammate and I decided to explore the photo-sharing aspect of the app.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="comp">
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>We explored apps that involved travel, like Travelog, Yonder, and TripMayor. We also studied popular networks in which young adults typically post about their travels like Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr. We analyzed our competitors based on their photo feeds, tagging and sorting systems, post submission, and social media. </p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="images/tumblr.jpg" alt="Tumblr"></li>
			<li><img src="images/yonder.jpg" alt="Yonder"></li>
			<li><img src="images/travelog.jpg" alt="Travelog"></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section class="synthesis">
		<h2>Synthesis</h2>
		<p>An important feature we wanted to implement was the ability to post multiple photos in one post; apps like Instagram, Yonder, and TripMayor only allowed one photo posts which we thought limited the potential and depth of the photo-sharing experience.</p>
		<p>Another aspect we found was that most travel apps functioned as social media outlets, with liking and commenting being an integral feature. Although many users were already familiar with the concept of liking and commenting, we decided that this feature deviated from our main objective, which was to present users with posts based on location, not by trending popularity. With that, we decided to use Tacking, a feature that is similar to tacking destinations to a world map, as a replacement for the liking system and a method in which users could compile a list of future destinations they are interested in visiting.</p>
		<p>While interviewing users, a common issue that arose was the lack of quality posts of popular photo-sharing apps. To address this concern, we found that our users preferred curated content, which ensured that only quality travel posts reached the front page. This also addressed the concern we had with obscure locations being overshadowed by popular travel destinations. Using curated content, we prevented reposts and common tourist locations from crowding a userâ€™s main feed.</p>

	<section class="persona">
		<h2>User Personas</h2>
		<p>Our client had done previous research and found that their target users are young travelers who have a 40-60k income. We made two of the following proto-personas: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="images/persona_travelblogger.jpg" alt="User Persona 1"></li>
			<li><img src="images/persona_business.jpg" alt="User Persona 2"></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section class="taskflow">
		<h2>User Task Flow</h2>
		<p>I created a basic user work flow that outlined how a user would submit a post, an important feature of our app.</p>
		<div><img src="images/taskflow.jpg" alt="User Task Flow"></div>
	</section>
	<section class="sketches">
		<h2>Sketches</h2>
		<p>I explored sketches and possible mobile app designs. I experimented with a chrome navigation bar and a dual top navigation bar that would accommodate both the navigation options as well as the search bar. We created a POP paper prototype and user-tested with it. We used the prototype to test the post submission process as well as its search functionality.</p>

	<section class="wireframes">
		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>I created wireframes to illustrate a basic skeleton of our app. These wireframes display our initial approach with a dual navigation bar but we had later decided to use the chrome navigation bar.</p>
